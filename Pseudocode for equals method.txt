equals(Object other):
  if this == other
    return true
  else if other is not an instance of MyList
    return false
  if other's size != this's size
    return false
  else
    get an iterator to this
    get an iterator to other
    if corresponding elements are not equal*
      return false
  return true

*Note that lists are allowed to have null elements.
Your code should not throw a NullPointException in that case.
Deal with this issue like you did in the contains, indexOf,
and lastIndexOf methods.
I.e., you will need to use the == operator to compare references to null,
but use the equals method to compare actual objects to each other.
